# Disklet Demo App

This app runs Disklet unit tests on React Native.

To launch the tests, first run `yarn install` in this folder to set up the dependencies, and then run either `yarn android` or `yarn ios`.

If you want to edit the Disklet library while using this app, run the `update-rn-test.sh` script located in the outer folder to copy your changes into `node_modules`.
